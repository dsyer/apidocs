# Cloud Foundry API Documentation Project
</div>

## Welcome

The goal of this site
is to bring a rich set of API documentation to the Cloud Foundry project, covering
both the HTTP APIs of the components and Cloud Controller, as well as the
raw message bus messages used to communicate between each of the Cloud Foundry
components.

## Goals

The goals of this site and project overall are:

- To establish thorough documentation on the communication of components.
- To track changes to functional boundries over time.
- To provide easy mechanism to extent and plug into Cloud Foundry through known APIs.

## Contributing

The documentation project is just beginning, so if you are interested in
contributing, check out the repository on
[GitHub](http://github.com/paasio/apidocs). To contribute, simply fork the site,
make your changes, and send a pull request.

## Status

Here is the status of several of the components:

* Cloud Controller - not started
* DEA - mostly complete
* Health Manager - all pages have content
* Router - all pages have content
* Service Gateway - not started
* Service Node - not started
* Stager - not started

There are a few other side wide items needing work:

* Navigational cleanup
* Documenting standard formatting

## About

Cloud Foundry project itself. This project is a community contributed project.
